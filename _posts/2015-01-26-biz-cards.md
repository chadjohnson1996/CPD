I created my first ever business cards! 
Yellow is my current ride or die color. They had to be yellow.

It's all about the angles.

I figured they'd stand out, at least a little, from the white/gray/black cards of my engineering peers.

Much love to Morgan McMahon for the photographs and being patient while I attempted to align everything.
