summary: Creating a template for a campus-wide endeavor.

Case Western Reserve University has something unique about its bathroom stalls. On the back on every one hangs a poster about sexual assault awareness, punctuated by commentary and comics.

In the spring, I attended a focus group on the bathroom posters hosted by SAVE (Sexual Assault and Violence Educators). Even though the posters themselves had been created less than four years ago, both the content and the style of the posters looked way older. Some points that came up: lack of LGBTQ resources, outdated online information, and general unattractiveness.  
At work, I mentioned to my supervisor that I had attended, and she responded surprisingly: "Do you want to redesign them?"
(Yes. Yes, I really wanted to.)

We'd be expanding the series to four posters instead of three, and I set out to tackle the things that irked me the most. The gray background, drab color scheme, and awkward speech bubbles had to go.
