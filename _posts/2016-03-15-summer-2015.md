Last summer, I had the opportunity to work with some pretty cool people. This post is a little past its prime, so I've kept the descriptions short.

[CoinDesk](http://www.coindesk.com/)
I created a series of illustrations for a white paper on bitcoin transactions.

[Geo.CEO](http://geo.ceo/)
A little CEO/geopin hybrid for this geodomain conference.

[DomainBuyApp](http://www.domainbuyapp.com/index.html "DomainBuyApp")
A blueprint-inspired logo and color scheme for an app that makes buying domains easy.

[MoneyTripping](https://twitter.com/blr13)
A tripped-out header for an unconventional finance blog.

[Spantree](http://spantree.net/)
Last, not but least, I had the oppurtunity to intern at Spantree this summer! They're fantastic people and I even got to write an article on the inner workings of their blog
Take a look at [using Jekyll as a content management system](http://spantree.net/blog/2015/08/14/jekyll-as-CMS.html "Jekyll as a CMS").
