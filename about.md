Hello! 

I'm Maria, a third year systems biology major at Case Western Reserve University. I've bounced between biology and computer science as majors, but I'm trying to also minor in computer science and data science.

Honestly, I'm interested in a lot of stuff! Currently, I want to learn more about human-centered design, whether it be based around products or interfaces. I've also been reading about designing for activism and for a community. 

My most recent projects are working with the Museum of Contemporary Art in Cleveland to improve their visitor experience and stepping into my new role as director of promotions for the University Program Board.

The previous version of this site was hosted on Tumblr and included only portfolio pieces. I'm hoping to expand to recounting my adventures in Cleveland, whether they be tech-focused, or volunteering, or doing cool things!
