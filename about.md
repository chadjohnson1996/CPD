Hello! 

I'm Maria, a second year computer science student at Case Western Reserve University. I actually just switched from a bio major and I'm looking to pursue minors in data science and marketing.
Honestly, I'm interested in a lot of stuff! Currently, I want to learn more about web development and UI/UX design. I've also been reading about designing for activism and for a community. 

My most recent personal projects - very new! - are getting this site running and creating some single-weight line art illustrations. New this year, I've joined Design for America, where we're working on streamlining how food is served to families of ill children at the nearby Ronald McDonald House, as well as going to improv contemporary dance classes. 

The previous version of this site was hosted on Tumblr and included only portfolio pieces. I'm hoping to expand to recounting my adventures in Cleveland, whether they be tech-focused, or volunteering, or doing cool things!

Here's a chart of some things I like and don't like. Anything in common?
