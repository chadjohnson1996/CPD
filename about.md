Hello! 

I'm Maria, a second year systems biology student at Case Western Reserve University. I've bounced between biology and computer science as majors, but I think this biology-focused data science track is a good fit.
Honestly, I'm interested in a lot of stuff! Currently, I want to learn more about human-centered design, whether it be based around products or interfaces. I've also been reading about designing for activism and for a community. 

My most recent personal projects - very new! - are getting this site running and creating some single-weight line art illustrations. New this year, I've joined Design for America, where we're working on streamlining how food is served to families of ill children at the nearby Ronald McDonald House. I've also started to take online classes on project management. I just finished one on typography!

The previous version of this site was hosted on Tumblr and included only portfolio pieces. I'm hoping to expand to recounting my adventures in Cleveland, whether they be tech-focused, or volunteering, or doing cool things!

Here's a chart of some things I like and don't like. Anything in common?
